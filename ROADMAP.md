# UpSkill Design System — Roadmap

Progress tracker. `[x]` done · `[-]` in progress · `[ ]` not started. Each phase is sized for 1–2 focused sessions and ends with an exit condition — don't start the next phase until the current one meets it.

## What "lite agentic" means here

Lite in two ways:

1. **Small surface.** The library targets one SaaS product with a few simple pages. The final component set is fixed: `Box`, `Stack`, `Inline`, `Text`, `Heading`, `Icon`, `Button`, form inputs (`TextField`, `Select`, `Checkbox`), and `Card`. Nothing more — a new component needs a reason a composition of these can't cover.
2. **Economic to maintain.** No orchestration layer, no always-on agents, no scheduled loops. Recurring automation is plain scripts and GitHub Actions calling REST APIs directly. MCP servers are reserved for interactive one-off tasks with a human in the loop — they are expensive per call and each one is maintenance surface.

"Agentic" means a small, fixed set of **developer-triggered moments** where Claude reads structured context the repo already provides (token JSON, component metadata, Airtable governance state, Figma variables) and produces something a script can't: an audit, a migration plan, a scaffold. Three moments are defined (Phase 7). Each has a named trigger, declared inputs, a concrete output, and a success signal. Anything that needs to run on every PR or merge is a script, not an agent. The whole system stays readable and maintainable by one person.

## Phase 1 — Infrastructure

- [x] Monorepo structure + npm workspaces
- [x] Token JSON files (primitives, theme, device layers)
- [x] GitHub repo
- [x] Airtable connected — `scripts/airtable-sync.js` pushes primitives/semantic/device tokens to three tables (one-directional, code → Airtable)
- [x] Style Dictionary: CSS custom properties output for web
- [x] Style Dictionary: custom platform config for device tokens — desktop to `:root`, tablet/mobile wrapped in `@media` blocks (single CSS output file)
- [x] Custom SD transforms: px→rem, font-weight string→numeric, `$root` rename, media query combiner
- [x] React + Vite + TypeScript in `packages/components`
- [x] Storybook: install + configure `addon-themes` (light/dark toggle via `data-theme`)
- [x] Token showcase stories (color swatches, spacing scale, type ramp, border radius — MDX)
- [x] GitHub Actions: token build check on PR

**Exit condition (met):** `npm run build:tokens` produces CSS + JS outputs from DTCG source; Storybook renders the token inventory in light and dark.

## Phase 1.5 — Token Foundation Review

> Audit and clean up the token layer before building on top of it. Nothing here changes the design — it removes noise and documents decisions.

- [x] Define component metadata schema (JSON per component: purpose, variants, relationships, anti-patterns) — example file in place
- [x] Remove Figma-artifact tokens from device layer — `layout.headerLayout` deleted (0 usages). `layout.min-width.column` (32 usages) and `layout.min-height.slider` (8 usages) kept: actively bound in Figma; will move to component CSS Modules when those components are built
- [x] ADR: layout tokens = values (spacing, grid config), not CSS properties
- [x] ADR: `space` vs `size` — `space` for spacing (gap, padding, margin); `size` for component dimensions (icon, avatar)
- [x] Review `space.inline` duplication across breakpoints
- [-] Audit semantic token naming — tokens should describe intent, not raw scale positions or ambiguous names

**Exit condition:** naming audit complete and any renames merged. Token names are stable enough that components and Airtable records can reference them without churn.

## Phase 2 — Agentic Foundation

> Make the system's state readable by an agent **before** components exist, so every component is born with structured context around it. No MCP required for any of this — plain scripts and committed JSON.

- [ ] Airtable governance fields on token records: `status` (active / deprecated), `owner`, `successor` (token path), `notes`
- [ ] `scripts/airtable-pull.js` — dump governance state to `packages/tokens/governance.json` via REST, so Claude and CI read Airtable state from a committed file, not live MCP calls
- [ ] `scripts/token-usage.js` — scan `packages/components` for `var(--ds-*)` references, output `token → [files]` JSON. Feeds the deprecation moment and the PR diff comment
- [ ] Validate the metadata schema with one end-to-end agent prompt — give Claude only a metadata file and ask it to explain when (not) to use the component; fix the schema where the answer is wrong
- [ ] Write the three agentic-moment definitions as prompt files in `.claude/commands/` (trigger, inputs, output, success signal — see Phase 7)

**Exit condition:** Claude can answer "what is this token's status, who owns it, and where is it used" from files in the repo alone, with zero MCP calls.

## Phase 3 — Component API Foundation

> The structural layer every component depends on. No design decisions — wiring existing tokens to CSS and the primitives everything else composes from.

- [x] CSS reset / base styles
- [ ] `grid.css` utility — consumes `var(--ds-grid-columns)`, `var(--ds-grid-gutter)`, `var(--ds-grid-margin)` to produce a reusable `.container`. No new tokens
- [ ] Typography scale styles — map `font.*` device tokens to base element and utility class styles
- [ ] `Box` — polymorphic `div` with CSS Module; padding via `space.inset.*` tokens
- [ ] `Stack` — `display: flex; flex-direction: column`; `gap` prop maps to `var(--ds-space-stack-*)`; `align` / `justify` props for alignment
- [ ] `Inline` — horizontal counterpart to `Stack`; `gap` maps to `var(--ds-space-inline-*)`; `align` / `justify` props; wraps by default (`flex-wrap: wrap`)
- [ ] Metadata file for each primitive (schema from Phase 1.5)
- [ ] Storybook: grid layout story, `Stack`/`Inline` gap-variant stories
- [ ] Wire `storybook-design-token` to SD CSS output for automatic token swatches

**Exit condition:** a sample page layout renders in Storybook using only `Box`/`Stack`/`Inline` and the grid utility — no ad-hoc CSS.

## Phase 4 — Core Components

> Establish the full pattern — token → CSS Module → component → metadata → story → Code Connect — so every later component has a template.

- [ ] `Text`, `Heading` — consume font device tokens and unitless line-heights
- [ ] `Icon` — single wrapper over a small fixed set of inline SVGs (hand-picked, no icon-library dependency); `currentColor` fill so it inherits text color; `size` prop maps to `size.*` tokens. Add a semantic `size.icon.*` alias if more than one component needs the same icon size
- [ ] `Button` — semantic color tokens, interaction states, size variants via `space.inset.*`; optional leading `Icon`
- [ ] Complete metadata file per component
- [ ] Code Connect: map `Button`, `Text`, `Heading` to their Figma components (one-off via Figma MCP) so design ↔ code navigation works in both directions
- [ ] Document the component pattern in CLAUDE.md "Add a coded component" so the scaffolding moment has a template to follow

**Exit condition:** all three components render in both themes with stories and metadata; clicking the Figma component shows the coded implementation via Code Connect.

## Phase 5 — SaaS Component Set

> The rest of the fixed library. After this phase the library is frozen — growth happens by composition.

- [ ] `TextField` (label, error state)
- [ ] `Select`
- [ ] `Checkbox`
- [ ] `Card`
- [ ] Metadata + stories for each
- [ ] One composed example page story (e.g. a settings form) built entirely from library components

**Exit condition:** the example page uses only library components and tokens; component set declared complete.

## Phase 6 — Automation (scripts and Actions only — no MCP, no agents)

- [x] GH Action: run `airtable-sync.js` on merge to `main` (direct REST, repo secret for the API key) — `sync-tokens.yml` pushes primitives, semantic, and device tokens
- [ ] GH Action: PR comment with token diff summary — deterministic script comparing built token output between base and head
- [ ] GH Action: run `airtable-pull.js` on a schedule or pre-merge so `governance.json` stays current
- [ ] Changelog generation from token diffs on release

**Exit condition:** merging a token change updates Airtable with no manual step, and token PRs show a diff comment. Everything in this phase runs without Claude.

## Phase 7 — Agentic Moments

> The three moments, implemented as `.claude/commands/` prompts (written in Phase 2). Developer-triggered, infrequent, each with a success signal. No continuous loops, no schedulers.

- [ ] **Figma token audit** — trigger: developer, before replacing `primitives.json` with a fresh Figma export. Inputs: Figma variables (Figma MCP, one-off read) + committed token files + `token-usage.json`. Output: a diff report flagging removed/renamed tokens with usages, broken aliases, scale-mixing and naming violations — then the cleaned export as a PR. Success signal: no Figma drift ever merges silently.
- [ ] **Token deprecation pass** — trigger: developer, after marking tokens deprecated in Airtable. Inputs: `governance.json` + `token-usage.json` + component metadata. Output: a migration PR replacing deprecated-token usages with their `successor`, plus notes where no successor fits. Success signal: zero component references to deprecated tokens.
- [ ] **Component scaffold** — trigger: developer, when starting a Phase 4/5 component. Inputs: metadata schema + an existing component as template + Figma design context (MCP, one-off). Output: component folder (index, CSS Module, stories, metadata) + Code Connect mapping. Success signal: build and Storybook pass with no manual restructuring.

**Exit condition:** each moment has been run once on a real task, met its success signal, and its prompt file updated with what was learned. After that, the system is "done" — maintenance only.
